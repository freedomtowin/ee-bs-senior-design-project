Automatic Speed Control looks to use speed coordination and safety techniques such as collision avoidance in order to assist drivers in specific situations and make the daily driving experience more enjoyable. This product will make our roads significantly safer resulting in a decreased number of automobile accidents. 

Operating a vehicle often requires skill and a high level of awareness. At times drivers may become distracted while behind the wheel creating the potential for an accident. Over confidence and impaired judgement are other traits that often lead to accident on roadways. ASC takes these driving deficiencies in to consideration and provides a system that prevents potential accidents due to these types of driving deficiencies. A distracted driver may not see a vehicle braking in front of him/her. Using various sensors, ASC will alert the driver of an object detected at a certain distance and the vehicle will automatically adjust the speed of the vehicle and prevent a collision. Once the speed has been reduced and the vehicles are a safe distance apart, the vehicle with ASC will adjust the speed again in order to continue on at a safe speed and distance relative to the vehicle in front of it. 

Other features of ASC are lane detection, blind spot monitoring, and vehicle overtake assistance. Operating a vehicle in one lane seems to be a very trivial aspect of driving, but at times remaining in one lane may become difficult due to certain road conditions or weather. ASC assists driver by using sensors to alert drivers when they are veering out of the designated lane of travel. This works hand in hand with the blind spot monitoring. 360 degree sensors will detect any object that may be hard to see due to lack of visibility and alert drivers when an object is detected. The vehicle overtake assistance uses lane detection, speed control coordination, and blind spot monitoring in order to allow the vehicle to safely overtake a vehicle on a one way road.
